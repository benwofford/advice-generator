## My process

- read README & style-guide in entirety.

- built app.js.
- tested and adjusted styling and javascript elements.
- wrote README.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- external API

### What I learned

I initially set up the width of the card element in such a way that would make it jump around the page whenever it was refreshed. I fixed this by setting the max-width to 50vw and adjusting the margin accordingly.
